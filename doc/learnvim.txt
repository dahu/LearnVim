USING HELP ~

Vim's internal help system is comprehensive, well indexed and easy to
navigate.  Beginners however often have difficulty knowing what to search for
in the first place.  Several solutions to that problem are provided here.
First is a guided tour of how to use Vim's help system.  Second is a broader
way to search for information within the help system.

Learning how to use Vim's Help: ~

|help.txt|	A quick overview of navigating Vim's help system.

|help-context|	A list of topic prepositions to specify the context of your
		help search.

|notation|	An explanation of how information is presented in the help
		files.

When newcomers see "complicated" commands in a Vim script or someone else's
vimrc and try to search for them in the help system, they often fail to find
what they're looking for.  Take for example the command sequence   gqip   to
reformat a paragraph.  Doing   :help gqip   will return the depressing
message, "Sorry, no help for gqip".  The problem here is in understanding
Vim's command syntax: |gq| and |ip| are separate entities. |gq| is an operator
command (one that takes a |motion|), whereas |ip| is an object (|text-object|
to be precise).  The take-away here is this tip: Learn to 'take apart'
commands you see in Vim.

Broadening Your Search ~

Use the ctrl+d key when you're typing ":help <term>".  It will list names that
match the term in front of the cursor.  See |c_CTRL-D| for additional uses.

Sometimes you don't know the exact search term you should be using to find
what you need in the help files.  It can be frustrating trying to guess the
precise turn of phrase the help-file author tagged.  Of course, it's obvious
when you get there, but just like a good joke: until you hear the punch-line,
you would never have guessed it would end like that.

To search the help system and return all matches, use the |:helpgrep| command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recipe: Using helpgrep to broaden your search ~

Problem: ~

You want to search by hexadecimal value, for example the character represented
by the value 0xAE (the ® symbol).  You've tried:
>
	:help hexadecimal
	:help hex
	:help search
	:help / and then searching within the help file for "hex"
<
If you had persisted in searching for subsequent matches in the last attempt,
you would have eventually found a table of |/character-classes| in which the
answer to your problem does indeed lie.  In itself, that is not a bad thing,
and it really didn't take too long to find the answer.  However, knowing that
you should have jumped into the help system with :help /character-classes is
by no means intuitive to the newcomer.

Solution: ~
>
	:helpgrep hex
	:cwindow
	/search

Produces: ~
>
	version7.txt|1018 col 48| |/\%x| \%x1a		search for character with 2 pos. hex number
	version7.txt|1020 col 50| |/\%u| \%u12ab	search for character with 4 pos. hex number
	version7.txt|1022 col 53| |/\%U| \%U1234abcd	search for character with 8 pos. hex number
<
Comments: ~

Admittedly, the information in the version_n_.txt files would probably not be
your primary resource, but it gives a good answer in this case.  The point is,
you can navigate the quickfix window for the answer you're seeking.  All the
normal Vim navigation methods are available, including hjkl, ctrl-f/ctrl-b,
and the method used here, searching with /.

Note: Because this helpfile describes this process, the quickfix window will
have entries from here, and because "learnvim" precedes "version",
alphabetically, you will need to repeat your search several times (use the  n
key) to jump past the learnvim entries.

                                 *lv_B_II* *learnvim-Fundamental-Concepts*
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF VIM ~

Vim has a steep learning curve that will take several days or weeks to even
begin turning from vertical.  Here is a good place to start:

|tutor|		The vimtutor is an interactive tutorial which teaches the
		fundamentals of Vim in around 30 minutes of hands-on fun.

|quickref|	Vim's Quick Reference:  An awesome overview and cheat-sheet.
		Of particular interest are the |option-list|, text objects
		(|Q_to|) and pattern search summary (|Q_pa|).

|lv_tips|	A collection of FAQs, Tips & Tricks, Howto's, recommendations
		and recipes for becoming a proficient Vim user. <TODO>

|vim-modes|	Vim is a modal editor.  Understanding the consequences and
		advantages of that is essential to mastering Vim.  Be sure to
		read the subsequent section on |mode-switching| too.

|user-manual|	The Table of Contents for Vim's User Manual.

Definitions ~

screen		The whole area that Vim uses to work in.  This can be a
		terminal emulator window.  Also called "the Vim window".

buffer		A buffer is just the word for the contents of a file.  Each
		buffer may be associated with one file path (the file it will
		be written to when you :w).  A buffer may not have an
		associated file path (like the empty buffer you get when you
		first start Vim).

window		A window is a place where a buffer can be displayed.  There is
		always at least one window open.  A buffer can be displayed in
		any number of windows simultaneously.  Having a buffer that
		isn't displayed in a window is useful when switching between
		different tasks, letting you walk away from half-finished
		work.  Having a buffer that is displayed in two windows can be
		useful when trying to work on one part of the buffer based
		upon some context provided in another part of the buffer
		that's far away.

tab page	A tab page is a place to put a group of windows.  There is
		always at least one tab page open.  Each tab must always have
		at least one window in it.  The maximum number of windows is
		bounded only by the size of the Vim window.

Note: Trying to create a one-to-one relationship between tab pages and buffers
is asking for trouble.  Lots of Vim commands change the buffer displayed in
the current window, and some others create a new window in the current tab
page.  Trying to lock a buffer to a single window inside a single tab page
won't work; at least, not without cutting you off from many useful commands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     *lv_B_III* *learnvim-Configuring-Vim*
CONFIGURATION FILES ~

/usr/share/vim/vimrc	The system-wide configuration file for both terminal
			and GUI Vim.  This file is used only if the user does
			not have a personal $HOME/.vimrc file.

/usr/share/vim/gvimrc	The system-wide configuration file for GUI Vim.  This
			file is used only if the user does not have a personal
			$HOME/.gvimrc file

$HOME/.vimrc		Personal configuration file for both terminal and GUI
			Vim.  You should create your own $HOME/.vimrc file to
			enable certain essential features, give sane values to
			important options and customise Vim to your
			preferences.  See |learnvim-vimrc| below for an
			annotated example .vimrc file you can use to get
			started.

$HOME/.gvimrc		Personal configuration file for GUI Vim.  You should
			create your own $HOME/.gvimrc file for the same
			reasons as with the .vimrc file.  The $HOME/.gvimrc
			file is also used to store GUI-specific settings like
			your GUI colorscheme, font and menu & toolbar options.
			See |learnvim-gvimrc| for an annotated example .gvimrc
			file you can use to get started.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              *lv_B_IV* *learnvim-Options*
CONFIGURATION OPTIONS ~

Vim is highly configurable through what are referred to as |options|. Read
through the beginning of that help file to understand how to show and set
options. As a quick overview:

- :set option=value	Sets "option" to "value"
- :set option?		Shows the current value of "option"

E.g. To check the current value of 'shiftwidth' and then change it to 4:
>
	:set shiftwidth?
	:set shiftwidth=4
<
To search for options in Vim, always remember to use a single quote ( ' )
character at the start of the option name to make sure your search doesn't
clash with other entries in the help system. E.g.   :help 'exp   will find the
'expandtab' option, but   :help exp   will find the |expression| evaluation
entry.

VIM OPTIONS BROWSER ~

Use the |:options| command to show an interactive window of all Vim's settings
including their current values and a brief description, grouped by function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recipe: Using the Options Browser to search for and change a Vim setting ~

Problem: ~

You want to change the bahaviour of something in Vim (like the tab & indent
settings, or how the Toolbar is displayed in the GUI), but you don't know the
option name and searching the help system doesn't appeal to you.

Solution: ~

For tabs and indents:
>
 	:options
<
Scroll down the Table of Contents and press Enter on the '15 tabs and
indenting' line. This will jump you to the set of options controlling how Vim
manages indentation.

Likewise, for the GUI Toolbar problem:
>
 	:options
<
Scroll down or search for GUI (/GUI) and press Enter on the '10 GUI' line.

Comments: ~

Changing a value on any of the 'set' lines and pressing Enter will update your
current settings. Add the 'set' line to your ~/.vimrc file (see
|learnvim-vimrc| below) to make the change permanent. Actually, you should
clean up the set line by removing the initial, unset version of the option
before adding it to your ~/.vimrc file.

Example: ~

Say you're browsing the options and decide that you want to enable 'smarttab'.
You see the line:
>
 	set nosta	sta
<
If you press Enter on that line then you will enable smarttabs. Copying that
line to your ~/.vimrc file will work, but it's unnecessary and unsightly to
have the option turned off and then on like that. So, when adding this to your
~/.vimrc, change the line like this:
>
 	set sta
<
Actually, it is a good practice to use the full name of an option so that when
you come back to your ~/.vimrc file in six months time you will be able to
understand what the setting means. So, change that line to:
>
 	set smarttab
<

Additional Options to Investigate ~

Read about the following options and consider adding them to your $HOME/.vimrc
too:

- 'colorscheme'	See |:syn-default-override|.  There are many more themes to
 		choose from at htp://www.vim.org/scripts/

- 'whichwrap'	Control which keys allow you to wrap around start and end of
  		lines.

- 'incsearch'	Incremental search - find while you type.

- 'spell' and	Enable spell checking in your preferred language.
  'spelllang'

- 'backup'	To keep backups of your files. There are several other related
		options with "backup" in their name.

MAKING YOUR PERSONAL CONFIGURATION PERSISTENT (GUI) ~

Your Own gvimrc File ~

Put this in your $HOME/.gvimrc :
>
	set t_vb=                      " Disable screen flash on error
<
Note: Some options, like t_vb, need to be set in both $HOME/.vimrc and
$HOME/.gvimrc because they are reset when the GUI is started.

Additional Options to Investigate ~

- 'colorscheme'	If you want to have the GUI use a different scheme to terminal
		Vim.

- 'guifont'	Font (or list of fonts to try) to use in the GUI. See the tip
  below about setting your guifont.

- 'guioptions'	Control which components and options of the GUI to use.
