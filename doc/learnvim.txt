*learnvim.txt*  A Suggested Path for Learning Vim

This help file introduces fundamental concepts, offers concrete advice for
correctly configuring a new Vim instance and outlines a progressive set of
topics for the enthusiastic newcomer to study and practise.

This is not a typical tutorial for Vim in that many topics are merely
introduced here with further study deferred to the excellent Vim Reference
Guide (|reference_toc|) and User Manual (|usr-toc|).

This file is structured with the following conventions:

CHAPTER HEADINGS are all caps and preceded by a line of # characters.
SECTIONS within a Chapter are all caps and preceded by a line of = characters.
1. Topics within a Section are numbered, in Title Case.
Recipes are blocked in lines of - characters.

USING HELP                                 *lv_B_I* *learnvim-Using-Help* 

Vim's internal help system is comprehensive, well indexed and easy to
navigate.  Beginners however often have difficulty knowing what to search for
in the first place.  Several solutions to that problem are provided here.
First is a guided tour of how to use Vim's help system.  Second is a broader
way to search for information within the help system.

1. Learning how to use Vim's Help        *learnvim-essential-introduction*
                                 
To read a help topic, move your cursor to that topic and type |ctrl-]|. To
return to where you came from, type |ctrl-t|. Try that now by reading the next
three essential (and brief) help topics. You will think I jest when I say that
a 200 line help file is brief, but I don't actually want you to read -all- of
that file -- just the first section. Sections are shown in red and are usually
right-aligned.

|help.txt|	A quick overview of navigating Vim's help system. Read
                everything in the first section - about 10 lines, and then
		jump back here.

		Note: that same help file is shown if you type the   |:help|
		      command without a topic.

|help-context|	A list of topic prepositions to specify the context of your
		help search. Again, this is only about 10 lines long.

		Note: The astute reader will notice that not only does it come
		      from the same file (|help.txt|) as the previous section
		      I asked you to read, but it was the very next section!
		      Why didn't I just ask you to keep reading through that
		      file while you were there? Because practising to
		      navigate Vim's help system is the most important skill
		      you first need to learn in mastering Vim.

|notation|	An explanation of how information is presented in the help
		files. -Now- I'm asking you to read 200+ lines in all of
		Section 4 of |intro.txt|. Actually, you can get away with
		skimming this one - but make sure you get a feel for how Vim's
		help files are layed out.

		Note: You may think that something so usefully named as
		      'intro.txt' should well be read in full. If you're into
		      reading gobs of documentation, go hard. However, to save
		      you time and trouble, this section of LearnVim has what
		      is considered to be the essential knowledge you need at
		      this stage.

2. Trees Within The Forest                  *learnvim-take-apart-commands*
                          
When newcomers see "complicated" commands in a Vim script or someone else's
vimrc and try to search for them in the help system, they often fail to find
what they're looking for.  Take for example the command sequence   gqip   to
reformat a paragraph.  Doing   :help gqip   will return the depressing
message, "Sorry, no help for gqip".  The problem here is in understanding
Vim's command syntax: |gq| and |ip| are separate entities. |gq| is an operator
command (one that takes a |motion|), whereas |ip| is an object (|text-object|
to be precise).  The take-away here is this tip: Learn to 'take apart'
commands you see in Vim. See |learnvim-namenclature| for more tips on
recognising and understanding Vim elements.

3. Broadening Your Search                     *learnvim-expand-help-terms* 
                         
Use the ctrl-d key when you're typing ":help <term>".  It will list matches
for the term in front of the cursor.  See |c_CTRL-D| for additional uses.

Another useful key is <Tab> which also expands terms on the Vim command line.
Depending on your settings ('wildmode' and 'wildmenu'), <Tab> will either
cycle through available matches or show a similar list to ctrl-d (and allow
you to cycle through that list).

4. The Shotgun Approach                                *learnvim-helpgrep*
                    
Sometimes you don't know the exact search term you should be using to find
what you need in the help files.  It can be frustrating trying to guess the
precise turn of phrase the help-file author tagged.  Of course, it's obvious
when you get there, but just like a good joke: until you hear the punch-line,
you would never have guessed it would end like that.

To search the help system and return all matches, use the |:helpgrep| command.

Recipe: Using helpgrep to broaden your search   *learnvim-recipe-helpgrep*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------{{{1
Problem: ~

You want to search by hexadecimal value, for example the character represented
by the value 0xAE (the ® symbol).  You've tried:
>
	:help hexadecimal
	:help hex
	:help search
	:help / and then searching within the help file for "hex"
<
If you had persisted in searching for subsequent matches in the last attempt,
you would have eventually found a table of |/character-classes| in which the
answer to your problem does indeed lie.  In itself, that is not a bad thing,
and it really didn't take too long to find the answer.  However, knowing that
you should have jumped into the help system with :help /character-classes is
by no means intuitive to the newcomer.

Solution: ~
>
	:helpgrep hex
	:cwindow
	/search

Produces: ~
>
	version7.txt|1018 col 48| |/\%x| \%x1a		search for character with 2 pos. hex number
	version7.txt|1020 col 50| |/\%u| \%u12ab	search for character with 4 pos. hex number
	version7.txt|1022 col 53| |/\%U| \%U1234abcd	search for character with 8 pos. hex number
<
Comments: ~

Admittedly, the information in the version_n_.txt files would probably not be
your primary resource, but it gives a good answer in this case.  The point is,
you can navigate the quickfix window for the answer you're seeking.  All the
normal Vim navigation methods are available, including hjkl, ctrl-f/ctrl-b,
and the method used here, searching with /.

Note: Because this helpfile describes this process, the quickfix window will
have entries from here, and because "learnvim" precedes "version",
alphabetically, you will need to repeat your search several times (use the  n
key) to jump past the learnvim entries.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------1}}}

5. More Resources                           *learnvim-community-resources*

The Vim community is strong, helpful and polite. The vim.wikia.com site, IRC
channel and mailing list are all great sources of information in learning Vim:

* http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Learn_to_use_help 
* Mailing Lists - http://www.vim.org/community.php
* IRC channel #vim on irc://irc.freenode.net

==============================================================================
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF VIM          *lv_B_II* *learnvim-Fundamental-Concepts*

<TODO>: General Remarks

1. Climbing the Vim Learning Curve                   *learnvim-beginnings*

Vim has a steep learning curve that will take several days or weeks to even
begin turning from vertical.  Here is a good place to start:

|tutor|		The vimtutor is an interactive tutorial which teaches the
		fundamentals of Vim in around 30 minutes of hands-on fun.

|quickref|	Vim's Quick Reference:  An awesome overview and cheat-sheet.
		Of particular interest are the |option-list|, text objects
		(|Q_to|) and pattern search summary (|Q_pa|).

|vim-modes|	Vim is a modal editor.  Understanding the consequences and
		advantages of that is essential to mastering Vim.  Be sure to
		read the subsequent section on |mode-switching| too.

|user-manual|	The Table of Contents for Vim's User Manual.

There are also some really good Beginner Tutorials available online for Vim:

* http://www.eng.hawaii.edu/Tutor/vi.html
* http://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/vim_tutorial.html
* http://www.derekwyatt.org/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/vim-novice-tutorial-videos/

Note: That's not a typing mistake in the first link above. It -is- a vi
tutorial! Vim came from vi, so many of Vim's fundemental editing features are
also available in vi.

2. Definitions                                *learnvim-basic-definitions*

screen		The whole area that Vim uses to work in.  This can be a
		terminal emulator window.  Also called "the Vim window".

buffer		A buffer is just the word for the contents of a file.  Each
		buffer may be associated with one file path (the file it will
		be written to when you :w).  A buffer may not have an
		associated file path (like the empty buffer you get when you
		first start Vim).

window		A window is a place where a buffer can be displayed.  There is
		always at least one window open.  A buffer can be displayed in
		any number of windows simultaneously.  Having a buffer that
		isn't displayed in a window is useful when switching between
		different tasks, letting you walk away from half-finished
		work.  Having a buffer that is displayed in two windows can be
		useful when trying to work on one part of the buffer based
		upon some context provided in another part of the buffer
		that's far away.

tab page	A tab page is a place to put a group of windows.  There is
		always at least one tab page open.  Each tab must always have
		at least one window in it.  The maximum number of windows is
		bounded only by the size of the Vim window.

Note: Trying to create a one-to-one relationship between tab pages and buffers
is asking for trouble.  Lots of Vim commands change the buffer displayed in
the current window, and some others create a new window in the current tab
page.  Trying to lock a buffer to a single window inside a single tab page
won't work; at least, not without cutting you off from many useful commands.

2. Namenclature                                *learnvim-namenclature*

Like any large and complex system, Vim has a dense vocabulary of terms
surrounding its interface, operation and configuration. Understanding this
terminology is essential for you to make significant progress in learning Vim.

When you see:		It means:

<CR>			Carriage Return, specifically, but realise that this
			is how Vim and vimmers talk about special keys in Vim.
			For example, the Escape key is written as <Esc>. See
			|keycodes| for a list of these special keys.

i_CTRL-G_j		This term consists of three separate parts.  The
			leading i_ tells us this key is used in insert mode.
			Find more about these in |help-context|.  The CTRL-g
			tells us the first key to type and the _j tells us
			that this is a key sequence, and that we should type
			j   after the CTRL-g. 

<TODO>: More terminology

==============================================================================
CONFIGURING VIM                      *lv_B_III* *learnvim-Configuring-Vim*

Vim has many options which can be set at runtime within Vim and can be put in
configuration files to make them permanent.

1. Files                                    *learnvim-configuration-files*

/usr/share/vim/vimrc	The system-wide configuration file for both terminal
			and GUI Vim.  This file is used only if the user does
			not have a personal $HOME/.vimrc file.

/usr/share/vim/gvimrc	The system-wide configuration file for GUI Vim.  This
			file is used only if the user does not have a personal
			$HOME/.gvimrc file

$HOME/.vimrc		Personal configuration file for both terminal and GUI
			Vim.  You should create your own $HOME/.vimrc file to
			enable certain essential features, give sane values to
			important options and customise Vim to your
			preferences.  See |learnvim-vimrc| below for an
			annotated example .vimrc file you can use to get
			started.

$HOME/.gvimrc		Personal configuration file for GUI Vim.  You should
			create your own $HOME/.gvimrc file for the same
			reasons as with the .vimrc file.  The $HOME/.gvimrc
			file is also used to store GUI-specific settings like
			your GUI colorscheme, font and menu & toolbar options.
			See |learnvim-gvimrc| for an annotated example .gvimrc
			file you can use to get started.

Note:                                   *learnvim-personal-vimrc-filename*
The table above refers to the personal vimrc file as $HOME/.vimrc, and this is
true for Linux and Mac systems, but in Windows it's located in $HOME/_vimrc.

2. Configuration Options                  *learnvim-configuration-options*

Vim is highly configurable through what are referred to as |options|. Read
through the beginning of that help file to understand how to show and set
options. As a quick overview:

- :set option=value	Sets "option" to "value"
- :set option?		Shows the current value of "option"
- :echo &option         An alternate way to show the value of "option"

E.g. To check the current value of 'shiftwidth' and then change it to 4:
>
	:set shiftwidth?
	:set shiftwidth=4
<
To search for options in Vim, always remember to use a single quote ( ' )
character at the start of the option name to make sure your search doesn't
clash with other entries in the help system. E.g.   :help 'exp   will find the
'expandtab' option, but   :help exp   will find the |expression| evaluation
entry.

3. GUI Option Browser                            *learnvim-option-browser*

Use the |:options| command to show an interactive window of all Vim's settings
including their current values and a brief description, grouped by function.

Recipe: Using the Options Browser to search for and change a Vim setting ~
-------------------------------------------------------------------------{{{1
Problem: ~

You want to change the bahaviour of something in Vim (like the tab & indent
settings, or how the Toolbar is displayed in the GUI), but you don't know the
option name and searching the help system doesn't appeal to you.

Solution: ~

For tabs and indents:
>
 	:options
<
Scroll down the Table of Contents and press Enter on the '15 tabs and
indenting' line. This will jump you to the set of options controlling how Vim
manages indentation.

Likewise, for the GUI Toolbar problem:
>
 	:options
<
Scroll down or search for GUI (/GUI) and press Enter on the '10 GUI' line.

Comments: ~

Changing a value on any of the 'set' lines and pressing Enter will update your
current settings. Add the 'set' line to your ~/.vimrc file (see
|learnvim-vimrc| below) to make the change permanent. Actually, you should
clean up the set line by removing the initial, unset version of the option
before adding it to your ~/.vimrc file.

Example: ~

Say you're browsing the options and decide that you want to enable 'smarttab'.
You see the line:
>
 	set nosta	sta
<
If you press Enter on that line then you will enable smarttabs. Copying that
line to your ~/.vimrc file will work, but it's unnecessary and unsightly to
have the option turned off and then on like that. So, when adding this to your
~/.vimrc, change the line like this:
>
 	set sta
<
Actually, it is a good practice to use the full name of an option so that when
you come back to your ~/.vimrc file in six months time you will be able to
understand what the setting means. So, change that line to:
>
 	set smarttab
-------------------------------------------------------------------------1}}}

2. Additional Options to Investigate   *learnvim-vimrc-additional-options*

Read about the following options and consider adding them to your $HOME/.vimrc
too:

- 'colorscheme'	See |:syn-default-override|.  There are many more themes to
 		choose from at htp://www.vim.org/scripts/

- 'whichwrap'	Control which keys allow you to wrap around start and end of
  		lines.

- 'incsearch'	Incremental search - find while you type.

- 'spell' and	Enable spell checking in your preferred language.
  'spelllang'

- 'backup'	To keep backups of your files. There are several other related
		options with "backup" in their name.

                                                   
3. Your Own gvimrc File                                  *learnvim-gvimrc*

Put this in your $HOME/.gvimrc :
>
	set t_vb=                      " Disable screen flash on error
<
Note: Some options, like t_vb, need to be set in both $HOME/.vimrc and
$HOME/.gvimrc because they are reset when the GUI is started.

4. Additional Options to Investigate  *learnvim-gvimrc-additional-options*

- 'colorscheme'	If you want to have the GUI use a different scheme to terminal
		Vim.

- 'guifont'	Font (or list of fonts to try) to use in the GUI. See the tip
  below about setting your guifont.

- 'guioptions'	Control which components and options of the GUI to use.

INTERMEDIATE TOPICS                         *lv_I* *learnvim-Intermediate*

Competencies ~

On completing this section, you will:

|lv_I_I|	Be able to ...

==============================================================================
MOTION                                                   *learnvim-motion*

If you haven't read all of |motion.txt| yet, now would be a good time. I know,
though, right? It's like 1300 lines long! That'd take hours to read, let alone
absorb... Well, I could say the journey of a thousand miles begins with the
first step, or the secret to eating an elephant is to do so bite at a time,
but I won't. Instead, I offer this path through the motion morass:

Operators & Text Objects ~

One of Vim's most powerful features is its ability to perform an action over a
specific portion of text. In Vim speak, the action is called an |operator| and
the portion of text is called a |text-object|. Get to know these operators
first:

|c|	(change) To delete a portion of text and enter insert mode immediately.
|d|	(delete) To delete a portion of text.
|y|	(yank) To copy a portion of text to the unnamed register.

And start using them with these text objects:

|w|	(word) To operate from the current word under the cursor.

EXERCISES ~

Copy the following line to your practice file (|setting-up-a-practice-file|):
>
  Angels and ministers of grace defend us.
<
Start with your cursor anywhere on that line in your practice buffer.
Type the following commands:

Commands:             Description: ~

1. 0                  - move to the first character on the line |0|
2. 3w                 - move forward three words (to "ministers")
3. cwVimmers<Esc>     - change the word "ministers" to "Vimmers"



==============================================================================
SEARCH AND REPLACE                               *learnvim-search-replace*

A common mistake is to think that the search and replace (|:substitute|)
command in Vim is:
>
    :%s/find/replace/flags
<
and that gets people by for a while, but there's a conceptual gap in there
waiting to bite the early learner. The actual search and replace command in
Vim is:
>
    :[range]s/find/replace/flags [count]
<
where   %   in the first command is a range. It means "the whole buffer" and
is equivalent to the longer form:   1,$   See |cmdline-ranges|.

There is much more to learn about the |:substitute| command. For instance, the
astute reader will have noticed that I didn't talk about [count].

Law of the Instrument ~

"It is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as
if it were a nail."                                   -- Abraham Maslow (1966)

Marks are great, but don't fall into the trap of over using your shiny, new
toys for every problem at hand. Take for example the operation of deleting
everything from the current cursor to a word you can see a few lines below in
your document. Having just learned about marks, it might seem like a good idea
to do this:
>
    ma/foo<CR>d`a
<
But there's a much better way to do that:
>
    d/foo<CR>
<
You're going to jump to your practise file and try that out now, aren't you? ;)

Recipe: Setting Up A Practice File   *learnvim-setting-up-a-practice-file*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------{{{1
Problem: ~
There's just too much to learn with Vim, and every time you learn a new thing,
it seems that the last cool tip you learned slips from memory.

Solution: ~
Have a practise file. It's a good idea to have a file you can jump to whenever
you want to test a newly learned Vim feature or continue to practise
previously learned material so that it doesn't fade away. Here's a short
recipe on how to do that:

1. Choose a location, say: ~/.vim/practice.txt (Create the directory if it
   doesn't exist - you'll be using it in a later tip.)
2. Edit that file in Vim and type the following command:
>
   mP
<
That sets the global P mark (|learnvim-marks|) on line one of your practice
file. The great thing about global marks ([A-Z]) is that not only do they
remember the line on which they were set (like local marks [a-z]), but they
also remember the file in which they were set. So, now at any time when you're
in Vim and you'd like to jump to your practice file, just type:
>
   'P
<
You can use |ctrl-o| to jump back to where you came from when you've finished
practising.

Note: You should practice that a few times now so you get the hang of it. Open
your ~/.vimrc file and then type   'P   to jump to your practice file, and
then |ctrl-o| to jump back. You could use   'P   to jump forward again, but
this is a great opportunity to mention |ctrl-i| which is used to jump forward
in the |jumplist| The astute reader will have noticed the help file that entry
is located in and hence the importance placed upon reading |motion.txt| within
this section of LearnVim.

Now, type |ctrl-o| enough times until you get back to wherever it was you
jumped here from. :)

MODERATE TOPICS                                 *lv_M* *learnvim-Moderate*

Competencies ~

On completing this section, you will:

|lv_M_I|	Be able to ...

==============================================================================

bufdo
	:bufdo e    to re-read all open buffers from disk
windo
args and argdo
macros
	:h key-notation

	record with qa yadda-yadda q
	add additional commands with capital letter: qA more-yadda q
	paste into document with "ap to edit commands
	re-read into register with 0"ay$ when cursor is on the line of commands
	@a to execute
	@@ to re-execute last macro (or : command, incidentally)
	10@a to run macro 10 times
	999@a to run it so many times it approximates 'repeat for as many times as possible'
	but see the next para about causing the macro to have a fail case or making it
	recursive.

	with a command that will fail, the macro aborts execution, so 1000@x will
	allow you to run it until it can't (providing you give a good fail, like
	moving down a line (so it doesn't wrap around the buffer and actually try to
	execute 1000 times)).

	Use recursive macros.

:h expand()
:h filename-modifiers

maps
	map \x :tabe <c-r>=expand('%:h')<CR>/
